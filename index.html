                <h3>Fishing</h3>
                <p>Enjoy some of the best fishing around at the Honey Lake. Our fishermen brag about the large mouth bass and a few pike have knocked people straight out of the boat. You'll find plenty of both and then bluegill and sunfish a plenty. Test your line, grab your bait (we also sell worms!!), and get out on the lake to catch yours now!</p>

                <h3>Swimming</h3>
                <p>Swim at the Honey Lake and take the edge off of the summer heat. We have a freshly sanded beach fully equipped with floats and sandbox toys for the littles and a brand new swimming platform for the bigger kids! Our safety rope helps keep the littles from going out too far (or ending up in the marl). Take a pontoon ride and jump off in the middle. Don't forget your life vests!</p>

                <h3>Camping</h3>
                <p>Get a lot for the night! Pitch a tent and enjoy some primitive camping. We have campsites on the lakeside, near kids' play areas, by the horseshoe pits, and across the road for a bit more privacy. Rent by the night, the weekend, the week, or the season! Don't forget that we have fully furnished campers available for rent too!</p>
